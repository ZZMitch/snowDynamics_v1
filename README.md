# snowDynamics_v1
Utility Code from version 1 of my snowDynamics processor, along with Jupyter Notebooks created while working on "Monitoring snow cover dynamics at 30-m resolution in higher latitude regions using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2". Version 1.1 was used for the final manuscript and in published products. 

This code creates snow dynamics products (e.g., start date, end date, length) for each snow-year and multi-yearly at a 30 m spatial resolution for all of Canada. All products can be accessed as COGs / STACs on GEO.ca: https://app.geo.ca/en-ca/map-browser/record/1ed7fdec-9a50-4fe9-aa16-78f9ee3f05bc

Processing is described in detail in the published paper and in a user guide available on GEO.ca
